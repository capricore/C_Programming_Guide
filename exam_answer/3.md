### (a) **Minimizing Time Required**  
To reverse a **singly linked list** efficiently, we can **reverse it in-place** using an iterative approach. This method ensures that each node is visited only once, making the **time complexity** \(O(n)\).  

#### **Algorithm Description (Iterative In-Place Reversal):**
1. Start with three pointers:
   - `prev = NULL` (initially pointing to nothing)
   - `current = head` (pointing to the first node)
   - `next` (used to store the next node temporarily during reversal)
2. Traverse through the list:
   - For each node, save the **next node**.
   - Reverse the current node’s pointer to point to `prev`.
   - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward.
3. After the loop ends, `prev` will point to the new head of the reversed list.

#### **Pseudo-Code:**
```c
void reverseLinkedList(Node** head) {
    Node* prev = NULL;
    Node* current = *head;
    Node* next = NULL;

    while (current != NULL) {
        // Save the next node
        next = current->next;
        
        // Reverse the current node's pointer
        current->next = prev;

        // Move pointers one step forward
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }

    // Update the head to the new first node
    *head = prev;
}
```

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **Big-O**: \(O(n)\)  
- **Reason**: Each node is visited once, and pointer operations (like `current->next = prev`) take constant time \(O(1)\).

#### **Approximate Time Required:**
- If the list has \(n = 10^6\) nodes, it will take about **O(n) operations**, which is efficient and should run in a fraction of a second on modern hardware.

### (b) **Minimizing Space Required**  
The **iterative in-place method** described above also minimizes the **space usage**. It only uses a **constant amount of extra memory**—specifically, a few pointers (`prev`, `current`, and `next`), regardless of the size of the linked list. This is the most space-efficient way to reverse a linked list.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **Big-O**: \(O(1)\)  
- **Reason**: No additional space is used except for the three pointers, which are reused throughout the process.

#### **Approximate Space Required:**
- Only a few bytes for the three pointers. Even for **very large lists**, the space usage will remain constant.

---

### **Alternative Method: Recursive Reversal (Not Recommended for Large Lists)**  
You could also reverse the list recursively, but this method has **higher space requirements** due to the function call stack.

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) (due to the recursion stack)

If \(n\) is large, a recursive approach could cause **stack overflow** or consume significant memory, making it inefficient for very large lists.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Best Method (for both time and space efficiency)**: Iterative in-place reversal.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)  
This approach is optimal for large lists, ensuring minimal time and memory usage.
