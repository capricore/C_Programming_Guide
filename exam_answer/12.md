To model the problem of scheduling tasks with dependencies in a car workshop as a graph, we can represent the tasks as nodes and the dependencies as directed edges. Here’s how to approach this problem and find a solution efficiently:

### **Graph Modeling**

1. **Vertices (Nodes)**: Each task that needs to be completed is represented as a vertex in the graph.

2. **Directed Edges**: If a task \(A\) must be completed before a task \(B\), we draw a directed edge from \(A\) to \(B\) (i.e., \(A \rightarrow B\)). This indicates that \(A\) is a prerequisite for \(B\).

3. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Since the tasks and their dependencies form a hierarchy, we ensure that the graph is a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. This means there are no cycles in the graph, which is a crucial property for scheduling tasks.

### **Finding the Schedule**

To find a valid ordering of the tasks such that all dependencies are respected, we can use **Topological Sorting**. This algorithm will help us determine an order to perform the tasks that respects their dependencies.

### **Algorithm: Kahn’s Algorithm for Topological Sorting**

Kahn's algorithm is a popular method for topological sorting of a DAG and operates in \(O(V + E)\) time complexity, where \(V\) is the number of vertices (tasks) and \(E\) is the number of edges (dependencies). Here’s how Kahn’s algorithm works:

1. **Calculate In-Degree**: 
   - Initialize an in-degree count for each vertex. The in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges directed towards it.
   
2. **Initialize the Queue**: 
   - Create a queue (or a list) of all vertices with in-degree 0. These are the tasks that can be started immediately since they have no prerequisites.

3. **Process the Queue**:
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Remove a vertex from the front of the queue (this represents a task to execute).
     - Add this vertex to the topological order.
     - For each outgoing edge from this vertex to its neighbors:
       - Decrease the in-degree of the neighboring vertices by 1.
       - If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue.

4. **Check for Completion**:
   - If all vertices are processed (i.e., added to the topological order), then the ordering is valid. If there are still vertices with non-zero in-degrees, it indicates a cycle, which means the tasks cannot be scheduled due to circular dependencies.

### **Pseudocode for Kahn's Algorithm**

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def topological_sort(tasks, dependencies):
    # Step 1: Create the graph
    in_degree = {task: 0 for task in tasks}  # Initialize in-degrees
    graph = defaultdict(list)  # Adjacency list representation

    # Step 2: Build the graph and in-degree count
    for prerequisite, task in dependencies:
        graph[prerequisite].append(task)  # Add edge from prerequisite to task
        in_degree[task] += 1  # Increment in-degree of task

    # Step 3: Initialize the queue with nodes of in-degree 0
    queue = deque([task for task in tasks if in_degree[task] == 0])
    top_order = []

    # Step 4: Process the queue
    while queue:
        current_task = queue.popleft()
        top_order.append(current_task)

        # Decrease the in-degree of neighboring tasks
        for neighbor in graph[current_task]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # Check for cycles
    if len(top_order) == len(tasks):
        return top_order  # Return valid topological order
    else:
        return None  # Cycle detected; scheduling is not possible
```

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in \(O(V + E)\) time, which is efficient for sparse graphs.
- **Space Complexity**: It requires \(O(V + E)\) space to store the graph and in-degree counts.

### **Conclusion**

By modeling the task scheduling problem as a directed acyclic graph and applying Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting, we can determine a valid order in which to complete the tasks while respecting their dependencies. This approach ensures that we efficiently find a solution with a worst-case complexity of \(O(E)\).
