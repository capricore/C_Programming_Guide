### **Initial Max-Heap Array:**
```
[72, 40, 59, 31, 11, 26, 3, 14, 29, 8]
```

1. **Step 1: Remove the Maximum Element**
   - The **maximum element** in a max-heap is always at the root (first element). So, we remove `72`.
   - To maintain the **complete binary tree structure**, we move the **last element** (in this case, `8`) to the root.

   **Array after replacing the root:**
   ```
   [8, 40, 59, 31, 11, 26, 3, 14, 29]
   ```

2. **Step 2: Restore the Max-Heap Property**
   - Now, we need to **heapify down** (percolate down) from the root to restore the max-heap property.
   - At each step, we compare the element with its two children and **swap with the largest child** if necessary.

---

### **Heapify Process**:
**Current Array:** `[8, 40, 59, 31, 11, 26, 3, 14, 29]`

1. **At index 0 (element = 8):**
   - Left child: 40 (index 1)
   - Right child: 59 (index 2)
   - **Largest child**: 59  
     -> Swap 8 with 59.

   **Array after first swap:**
   ```
   [59, 40, 8, 31, 11, 26, 3, 14, 29]
   ```

2. **At index 2 (element = 8):**
   - Left child: 26 (index 5)
   - Right child: 3 (index 6)
   - **Largest child**: 26  
     -> Swap 8 with 26.

   **Array after second swap:**
   ```
   [59, 40, 26, 31, 11, 8, 3, 14, 29]
   ```

3. **At index 5 (element = 8):**
   - No children (it's a leaf), so no further swaps are needed.

### **Final Heap Array:**
```
[59, 40, 26, 31, 11, 8, 3, 14, 29]
```

---

### **Result:**
After removing the maximum element and restoring the heap, the **final heap array** is:

```
[59, 40, 26, 31, 11, 8, 3, 14, 29]
```

This array represents the max-heap after the `deletemax` operation.
