### **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm Overview**

- **Vertices**: \(V\)  
- **Edges**: \(E\)  
- **Goal**: Find the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices in a **directed weighted graph**.  
- **Priority Queue Usage**: The algorithm uses a **priority queue** to always extract the vertex with the minimum distance and update the distances to its neighbors.

---

## (a) **Heap as a Priority Queue**

- **Operations** in Dijkstra's algorithm using a **min-heap**:
  - **Extract-min**: \(O(\log V)\) (to extract the vertex with the minimum distance).
  - **Decrease-key**: \(O(\log V)\) (to update distances).

- **Total Time Complexity**:
  - We extract the minimum vertex \(V\) times: \(V \times O(\log V)\).
  - We relax all \(E\) edges: \(E \times O(\log V)\).

\[
\text{Total: } O((V + E) \log V)
\]

---

## (b) **Linked List Sorted by Weight as a Priority Queue**

- **Operations** using a **sorted linked list**:
  - **Extract-min**: \(O(1)\) (because the minimum element is always at the head).
  - **Decrease-key**: \(O(V)\) (because we need to find the correct position for the updated key).

- **Total Time Complexity**:
  - Extracting the minimum vertex \(V\) times: \(V \times O(1) = O(V)\).
  - Relaxing all \(E\) edges: \(E \times O(V)\).

\[
\text{Total: } O(E V)
\]

---

## (c) **Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) as a Priority Queue**

- **Operations** using a **balanced BST**:
  - **Extract-min**: \(O(\log V)\).
  - **Decrease-key**: \(O(\log V)\).

- **Total Time Complexity**:
  - Extracting the minimum vertex \(V\) times: \(V \times O(\log V)\).
  - Relaxing all \(E\) edges: \(E \times O(\log V)\).

\[
\text{Total: } O((V + E) \log V)
\]

---

## (d) **Heap vs. BST: Which is Better?**

### **Big-O Comparison:**
Both **heaps** and **balanced BSTs** give a time complexity of:
\[
O((V + E) \log V)
\]
However, **heaps** are generally preferred because:
1. **Faster decrease-key operations**: Heaps have less overhead compared to balanced BSTs.
2. **Implementation simplicity**: Min-heaps are easier to implement and have better cache performance due to their array-based structure.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **(a) Heap**: \(O((V + E) \log V)\)  
- **(b) Sorted Linked List**: \(O(E V)\)  
- **(c) Balanced BST**: \(O((V + E) \log V)\)  
- **(d) Heap vs. BST**: **Heaps** are preferred for efficiency and simplicity.
