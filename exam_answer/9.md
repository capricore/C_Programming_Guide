Let's analyze the recurrence relation:

$$
T(n) = 4 \cdot T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + n^2
$$

with $\(T(1) = 0\)$.

We will apply **Master Theorem** to determine the time complexity.

---

### **Step 1: Identify Parameters for Master Theorem**
Master Theorem applies to recurrences of the form:

$$
T(n) = a \cdot T\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n)
$$

where:
- \(a = 4\): Number of recursive calls.
- \(b = 2\): At each level, the input size is divided by 2.
- \(f(n) = n^2\): The work done at each level.

We need to compare $\(f(n) = n^2\)$ with $\(n^{\log_b a}\)$.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate $\(n^{\log_b a}\)$**
$$
\log_b a = \log_2 4 = 2
$$

So, $\(n^{\log_b a} = n^2\)$.

---

### **Step 3: Compare $\(f(n) = n^2\)$ with $\(n^2\)$**
- Since $\(f(n) = n^2\)$ is equal to $\(n^{\log_b a}\)$, this falls under **Case 2** of the Master Theorem.

---

### **Step 4: Apply Case 2 of Master Theorem**
In **Case 2**, when $\(f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})\)$, the time complexity is:

$$
T(n) \in \Theta(n^2 \log n)
$$

### **(a): Depth of the Recursion Tree**
#### **How to Determine the Depth of the Recursion Tree**
1. **At each level**, the input size decreases by a factor of \(b\). 
2. **Base case**: The recursion stops when the input size becomes 1, i.e., $\( \frac{n}{b^d} = 1 \)$, where \(d\) is the depth of the tree.

$$
d = \log_b n
$$

Thus, the **depth of the recursion tree** is $\(d = \log_b n\)$.

At each level, the input size is divided by 2, so the **depth** of the recursion tree is:

$$
\log_2 n
$$

---

### **Answer to Part (b): Time Complexity**
The time complexity of the algorithm is:

$$
\Theta(n^2 \log n)
$$
