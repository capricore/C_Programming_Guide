### Key concepts for 2-3-4 Tree:
- A **2-3-4 tree** allows nodes to have 1, 2, or 3 keys (2-node, 3-node, 4-node).
- Insertion may cause **overflow** (creating a 4-node) and require **splitting**.
- When a **4-node** splits, the **middle key** is promoted to the parent, and the other two keys become children nodes.

### **Step-by-Step Insertion**

1. **Insert 6**  
   - Tree:  
     ```
     [6]
     ```

2. **Insert 3**  
   - Tree:  
     ```
     [3, 6]
     ```

3. **Insert 7**  
   - Tree:  
     ```
     [3, 6, 7]
     ```
     - This is a **4-node** now, and it will split upon the next insertion.

4. **Insert 5**  
   - **Split** the 4-node `[3, 6, 7]`. Promote `6` to a new root, leaving `3` and `7` as child nodes:
     ```
         [6]
        /   \
      [3]   [7]
     ```
   - Now insert `5` into the left child `[3]`:
     ```
         [6]
        /   \
     [3, 5] [7]
     ```

5. **Insert 1**  
   - Insert `1` into the left child `[3, 5]`:
     ```
         [6]
        /   \
     [1, 3, 5] [7]
     ```

6. **Insert 2**  
   - **Split** the left child `[1, 3, 5]`. Promote `3` to the root. Now the tree becomes:
     ```
         [3, 6]
        /  |   \
     [1] [5] [7]
     ```

7. **Insert 4**  
   - Insert `4` into the middle child `[5]`:
     ```
         [3, 6]
        /  |   \
     [1] [4, 5] [7]
     ```

---

### **Final Tree**
After inserting all the keys, the final 2-3-4 tree is:
```
    [3, 6]
   /  |   \
[1] [4, 5] [7]
```
