To extend **Prim’s algorithm** to handle **unconnected graphs**, the main idea is to run the algorithm independently for each **connected component**. We need to ensure that every component is processed by the algorithm. Below is a **sketch** of the enhanced version using words and pseudocode:

## **Enhanced Prim's Algorithm for Unconnected Graphs**

### Key Idea
1. Instead of starting Prim’s algorithm from a single arbitrary vertex, we must ensure that **every connected component** is processed.
2. We keep **track of visited vertices** so that if any unvisited vertex is found, we initiate a new run of Prim’s algorithm from that vertex.
3. Each time Prim's algorithm completes for one component, the **next unvisited vertex** will trigger the construction of a new MST for another component.

### **Pseudocode for Enhanced Prim's Algorithm**
``` 
Input: Graph G(V, E) with |V| vertices and |E| edges
Output: MST for each connected component

visited = [false] * |V|   # Track visited vertices for all components
allMSTs = []               # Store the MSTs for each component

function PrimComponentMST(start):
    MST = []                      # Store the MST for this component
    priorityQueue = new MinHeap()  # Min-heap for fringe vertices
    add start to priorityQueue with weight 0

    while priorityQueue is not empty:
        (u, weight) = priorityQueue.removeMin()
        if visited[u]:
            continue               # Skip if already part of MST
        visited[u] = true          # Mark as visited
        MST.append(u)              # Add u to MST

        # Add neighbors of u to the queue
        for (v, w) in neighbors(u):
            if not visited[v]:
                priorityQueue.insert((v, w))  # Add to priority queue

    return MST

# Main loop to ensure all connected components are processed
for v in range(0, |V|):
    if not visited[v]:   # If vertex is not visited, it starts a new MST
        componentMST = PrimComponentMST(v)
        allMSTs.append(componentMST)

return allMSTs  # Return the list of MSTs for all components
```

### **Explanation**
1. **Tracking visited vertices**: We maintain a `visited` array to track whether each vertex has been processed. This allows us to identify new connected components.
2. **Run Prim’s algorithm independently**: If a vertex is found unvisited, we know it belongs to a new connected component. We run **Prim’s algorithm** starting from that vertex to generate the MST for the component.
3. **Storing MSTs**: Each MST is collected in `allMSTs` to store the MST for every component.

---

### **Time Complexity**
- **Same as standard Prim's algorithm**: \(O((V + E) \log V)\) for each component.
- **Total time complexity**: The sum of Prim’s algorithm’s time for all connected components, which is still \(O((V + E) \log V)\) overall.

---

This enhancement ensures that the **algorithm terminates only after all connected components** are processed, constructing an MST for each one.
