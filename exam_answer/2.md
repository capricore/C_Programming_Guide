# **Proof that $T(n) = 3n^2 + 15n + 7$ is in $O(n^2)$**

### **Definition of Big-O**  
A function $T(n)$ is in $O(f(n))$ if there exist positive constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that:

$$
T(n) \leq c \cdot f(n) \quad \text{for all} \quad n \geq n_0
$$

Here, $f(n) = n^2$, and we want to prove that $T(n) = 3n^2 + 15n + 7 \in O(n^2)$.

### **Proof**

We need to find constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that:

$$
3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq c \cdot n^2 \quad \text{for all} \quad n \geq n_0
$$

#### Step 1: Bound the lower-order terms
For large $n$, the $3n^2$ term dominates, but we also need to account for the lower-order terms $15n$ and $7$. Let's overestimate these terms to ensure the inequality holds for all $n \geq n_0$.

- $15n \leq 15n^2$ for $n \geq 1$  
- $7 \leq 7n^2$ for $n \geq 1$  

So, we can rewrite:

$$
3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq 3n^2 + 15n^2 + 7n^2 = 25n^2
$$

#### Step 2: Choose appropriate values for $c$ and $n_0$
From the inequality above, we can set:

- $c = 25$  
- $n_0 = 1$  

Thus, for all $n \geq 1$:

$$
3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq 25n^2
$$

### **Conclusion**

Since we have found constants $c = 25$ and $n_0 = 1$ such that:

$$
3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq 25n^2 \quad \text{for all} \quad n \geq 1,
$$

we conclude that $T(n) = 3n^2 + 15n + 7 \in O(n^2)$.
