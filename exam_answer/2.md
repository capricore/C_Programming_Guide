To prove that \(T(n) = 3n^2 + 15n + 7\) is in \(O(n^2)\), we need to use the formal definition of Big-O notation.

### **Definition of Big-O**  
A function \(T(n)\) is in \(O(f(n))\) if there exist positive constants \(c\) and \(n_0\) such that:

\[
T(n) \leq c \cdot f(n) \quad \text{for all} \quad n \geq n_0
\]

Here, \(f(n) = n^2\), and we want to prove that \(T(n) = 3n^2 + 15n + 7 \in O(n^2)\).

### **Proof**

We need to find constants \(c\) and \(n_0\) such that:

\[
3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq c \cdot n^2 \quad \text{for all} \quad n \geq n_0
\]

#### Step 1: Simplify the left side for large \(n\).
For large \(n\), the \(3n^2\) term dominates, but we also need to account for the lower-order terms \(15n + 7\). To make the inequality hold for all \(n \geq n_0\), we can overestimate these lower-order terms.

Since \(15n \leq 15n^2\) for \(n \geq 1\) and \(7 \leq 7n^2\) for \(n \geq 1\), we can write:

\[
3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq 3n^2 + 15n^2 + 7n^2 = 25n^2
\]

#### Step 2: Choose appropriate values for \(c\) and \(n_0\).
From the inequality above, we can set \(c = 25\). So, for \(n \geq n_0 = 1\):

\[
3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq 25n^2
\]

---

### **Conclusion**
We have shown that \(T(n) = 3n^2 + 15n + 7 \leq 25n^2\) for all \(n \geq 1\). Thus, by the definition of Big-O, \(T(n) \in O(n^2)\) with:

- \(c = 25\)
- \(n_0 = 1\)
