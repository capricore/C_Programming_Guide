### (a) Expected Average-Case Time Complexity

**Expected Average-Case Complexity: O(1 + α)**

Where:
- **O(1)**: This term represents the time taken to compute the hash function and access the chain in the hash table.
- **α (alpha)**: This is the load factor, defined as $\( \alpha = \frac{m}{n} \)$, where $\( m \)$ is the number of products (inserted into the table) and $\( n \)$ is the size of the hash table array.

In the average case, when the hash table is well-distributed and the load factor is low (meaning fewer collisions), we expect to traverse a short linked list (or chain). Hence, we can say that on average, we will have to examine a number of entries proportional to the load factor, leading to the expected average-case time complexity of $\( O(1 + \alpha) \)$.

### (b) Worst-Case Time Complexity

**Worst-Case Complexity: O(m)**

In the worst case, all product IDs hash to the same index in the hash table due to poor hash function performance or an unfortunate choice of product IDs. This means that the chain at the hashed index could contain all $\( m \)$ products. Therefore, we would need to traverse the entire chain to count occurrences, which results in a worst-case time complexity of $\( O(m) \)$.

### Algorithm Description

Here's a brief description of how the algorithm would work:

1. **Input**: A product ID to search for and the hash table.
2. **Hash the Product ID**: Compute the hash of the product ID to find the corresponding index in the hash table.
3. **Access the Chain**: Retrieve the linked list (chain) at the computed index.
4. **Count Occurrences**:
   - Initialize a count variable to zero.
   - Traverse the linked list and for each node:
     - If the product ID matches, increment the count.
5. **Output**: Return the count of occurrences.

This approach allows us to efficiently find the number of occurrences of a product ID in a hash table using chaining, leading to the time complexities discussed above.
