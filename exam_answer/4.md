(a) Average-Case Time Complexity
In the average case, the elements are distributed relatively evenly across the hash table. The expected time complexity for searching an element in a hash table with chaining is:
𝑂(1+𝛼)
Where:
𝛼=𝑚/𝑛 is the load factor, which represents the average number of elements per slot in the hash table.
𝑂(1) is the time to compute the hash function and access the appropriate linked list.
𝑂(𝛼) is the time to traverse the linked list at that slot, proportional to the length of the list.
So, the average-case time complexity is:
𝑂(1+𝛼)
If the load factor is low (e.g., 𝛼≪1), the performance is close to O(1).

(b) Worst-Case Time Complexity
In the worst case, all elements hash to the same index, forming a single long linked list of size 𝑚. In this scenario:

The search time is proportional to the length of the list, which is 𝑂(𝑚)
The worst-case time complexity is: 𝑂(𝑚)

Pseudocode for Counting Occurrences:

function countOccurrences(productID, hashTable):
    index = hash(productID) % n  // Compute the hash and find the index
    count = 0
    node = hashTable[index]  // Get the linked list at that index

    while node is not NULL:
        if node.productID == productID:
            count += 1
        node = node.next  // Move to the next node in the list

    return count
