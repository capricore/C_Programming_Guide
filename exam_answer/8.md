### (a) **Most Efficient Method without Memory Limitations**
**Method**: **Counting Sort**

Since the array only contains 0s and 1s, counting sort is the most efficient method.  
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Count the number of 0s in the array.
  2. Place all the counted 0s at the beginning of the array.
  3. Place 1s in the remaining positions.

- **Time Complexity**:  
  **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we traverse the array twice: once to count the 0s and 1s, and once to overwrite the original array.

### (b) **In-Place Sort with Limited Memory**
**Method**: **Two-Pointer Approach** (also known as the **Partitioning Method**)

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`).
  2. Move `left` forward until it finds a 1.
  3. Move `right` backward until it finds a 0.
  4. Swap the 1 at `left` with the 0 at `right`.
  5. Repeat until `left >= right`.

- **Time Complexity**:  
  **O(n)**. This method ensures that each element is checked at most once, giving a linear time complexity.

### **Explanation of Choice**
- In both cases, **O(n)** is the best possible time complexity since we need to inspect every element in the array.
- The **Counting Sort** method is optimal when space is not an issue, as it avoids swaps.
- The **Two-Pointer Approach** is preferred when sorting in-place since it efficiently swaps elements with minimal overhead and maintains linear performance.
