### (a) Most Efficient Method with No Memory Limitations

**Method**: Counting Sort

**Worst-Case Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

#### Explanation:
1. **Counting**: We can traverse the binary array and count the number of 0s and 1s.
2. **Constructing the Sorted Array**: Once we have the counts, we can create a new array (or overwrite the original) with the counted number of 0s followed by the counted number of 1s.

Here's a brief breakdown of how the algorithm works:
- Initialize two counters: `count0` and `count1`.
- Traverse the array, incrementing `count0` for each 0 and `count1` for each 1.
- Construct the sorted array using the counts, filling the first `count0` positions with 0s and the next `count1` positions with 1s.

#### Pseudocode:
```plaintext
function sortBinaryArray(arr):
    count0 = 0
    count1 = 0

    for element in arr:
        if element == 0:
            count0 += 1
        else:
            count1 += 1

    for i from 0 to count0 - 1:
        arr[i] = 0
    for i from count0 to count0 + count1 - 1:
        arr[i] = 1

    return arr
```

### (b) Most Efficient In-Place Method with Memory Limitations

**Method**: Two-Pointer Technique

**Worst-Case Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

#### Explanation:
1. **Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to traverse the array. One pointer (`left`) starts at the beginning of the array and the other (`right`) starts at the end.
2. **Swapping**: 
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right until you find a 1.
   - Move the `right` pointer to the left until you find a 0.
   - If `left` is less than `right`, swap the values at these pointers (i.e., swap the 1 at `left` with the 0 at `right`).
   - Repeat the process until the two pointers meet.

This method effectively partitions the array into 0s on the left and 1s on the right without needing additional memory, making it an in-place sort.

#### Pseudocode:
```plaintext
function sortBinaryArrayInPlace(arr):
    left = 0
    right = length(arr) - 1

    while left < right:
        while arr[left] == 0 and left < right:
            left += 1
        while arr[right] == 1 and left < right:
            right -= 1
        if left < right:
            swap(arr[left], arr[right])
            left += 1
            right -= 1

    return arr
```
